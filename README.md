# About me

Hey there, I'm Sahil Hussain. Currently I'm pursuing BTech CSE at The Assam Royal Global University. I've been passionately diving into full-stack web development and exploring the exciting world of DevOps. I love building meaningful projects, experimenting with code, and documenting my learning journey on GitHub to inspire and help others in the community. When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll find me working out, strumming my guitar, or writing to express my ideas.
